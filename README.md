The player with the most knowledge and highest score moves on to the bonus round where they can win even more prizes.

## Project Development Notes:
We took as much advantage of planning time as we could, working from the wireframe below all throughout the project and utilizing a daily retro log (also linked below) as well as github issues to keep our group organized and on task. We worked mostly together, which helped keep syntax errors to a minimum and allowed to immediate feedback on design and functionality decisions.
